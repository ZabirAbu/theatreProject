# Theatre Project
This is a booking system that allows theatres to store details of the shows they're currently running, 
customers' information such as their contact details and type of membership and ticket prices 
which can be stored, viewed, and changed whenever needed. Information is stored in a random access file which is a type 
of memory used to access data "directly" based on their record number.
